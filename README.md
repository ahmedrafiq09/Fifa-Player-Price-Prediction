### FIFA Player Value Prediction Project Overview âš½

## Description:

The "FIFA Player Price Prediction" project is a comprehensive exploration into forecasting the monetary value of football players while categorizing them as goalkeepers or outfield players. This endeavor commences with a meticulous problem framing phase, emphasizing the primary objective of predicting player values based on a diverse array of attributes and specialized goalkeeper statistics. The dataset utilized for this analysis is sourced from "player_stats.csv" and undergoes thorough exploration and visualization using the Pandas library, revealing crucial player information including height, weight, age, skills, and financial values.

## Approach:

The player value prediction model is crafted with a keen focus on feature selection, prioritizing essential attributes such as height, weight, age, and talent markers. To achieve this, a Decision Tree Regressor is chosen for its adaptability in capturing non-linear patterns and intricate feature interactions. Subsequently, the model is trained on the dataset, acquiring insights to predict player values, and rigorously evaluated utilizing metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Concurrently, a dedicated goalkeeper classification model is developed by establishing a binary target variable based on goalkeeping attributes. To accomplish this, a Decision Tree Classifier is selected for its efficacy in binary classification tasks. The model is then trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix to assess its performance comprehensively.

## Tools Utilized:

- Python: Utilized for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation processes.
- Pandas: Employed for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization tasks.
- Scikit-learn: Leveraged for implementing machine learning algorithms, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- Decision Tree Regressor: Chosen for predicting player values due to its capability in capturing complex patterns.
- Decision Tree Classifier: Selected for goalkeeper classification tasks owing to its effectiveness in binary classification scenarios.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared: Utilized as evaluation metrics for the player value prediction model.
- Accuracy and Confusion Matrix: Employed as evaluation metrics for the goalkeeper classification model.

### This detailed project overview showcases a structured approach to solving complex problems in the domain of football player valuation, highlighting the utilization of prominent tools and methodologies in data science and machine learning.
