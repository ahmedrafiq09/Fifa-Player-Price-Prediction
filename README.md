# Fifa-Player-Price-Prediction
The "FIFA Player Price Prediction" project is a comprehensive exploration into predicting the monetary value of football players and classifying whether a player is a goalkeeper or not. 
The project begins by framing the problem, highlighting the primary objective of predicting player values based on a diverse set of attributes and goalkeeper-specific statistics. The dataset, sourced from "player_stats.csv," is thoroughly explored and visualized using the Pandas library, revealing key player information such as height, weight, age, skills, and financial values.
